# Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn prediction, also known as customer attrition prediction, is the process of using data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to identify customers who are at risk of discontinuing their relationship with a business. The goal of customer churn prediction is to proactively identify these at-risk customers and take targeted actions to prevent them from leaving, thereby increasing customer retention rates and maintaining a healthy customer base.
