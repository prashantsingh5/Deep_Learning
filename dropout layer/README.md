# Dropout layer

ðŸŽ¯ What is Dropout?
Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting, a common challenge where models become too specialized to the training data and struggle to generalize to new, unseen data. By selectively "dropping out" a fraction of neurons during training, dropout helps to improve the network's generalization performance.

ðŸ”— Why is Dropout Important?
Imagine teaching a student to solve math problems using only one tutor. The student might become overly reliant on the tutor's approach and struggle with different problems. Similarly, neural networks can become too dependent on specific features, making them less adaptable to variations in data. Dropout, acting as a team of diverse tutors, ensures that different subsets of neurons learn and contribute independently, creating a robust and versatile network.
