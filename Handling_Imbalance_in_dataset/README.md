# Handling Data Imbalance

Data imbalance refers to a situation in a dataset where the distribution of classes is highly skewed, meaning that one class has significantly more samples than the other(s). This is particularly common in classification problems where one class represents a rare event or outcome, while the other class(es) are more prevalent. Imbalanced data can pose challenges for machine learning models as they tend to bias towards the majority class, resulting in poor performance on the minority class.

Tackling data imbalance is crucial to ensure that the model can effectively learn from all classes and make accurate predictions.
