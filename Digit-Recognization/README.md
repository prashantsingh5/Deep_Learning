# Digit Recognition using Neural Network 

Description:

This project is a digit recognition application that uses a neural network to classify hand-drawn digits from images. The neural network is trained on a popular dataset called MNIST, which consists of a large collection of handwritten digit images. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the digit represented by an input image.

Key Features:

1. Data Preparation:
The MNIST dataset contains thousands of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The images are preprocessed and normalized to ensure consistent input for the neural network.
2. Neural Network Architecture:
The neural network architecture consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer is designed to match the size of the input images, while the output layer has 10 nodes, each corresponding to a digit (0-9).
3. Training and Validation:
The model is trained using the training subset of the MNIST dataset. Training involves forward and backward propagation to adjust the weights of the network using an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). A validation subset is used to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.
4. Testing and Evaluation:
Once trained, the model is evaluated using a separate test subset of the dataset. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
5. Prediction:
Users can input their own digit images (hand-drawn or downloaded) to the application. The neural network then processes the image and predicts the digit it represents.
6. User Interface (Optional):
You can create a simple user interface where users can draw or upload their own digit images and see the model's prediction.
