# Image Classification

Description:

Welcome to my image classification project where I've leveraged the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify images from an inbuilt dataset using TensorFlow. This project demonstrates my passion for deep learning and computer vision and showcases my proficiency in building and training neural networks.

Project Highlights:

🔍 Problem Statement: In this project, I've tackled the challenge of classifying images into multiple categories. The dataset consists of diverse images, and the goal is to create a model that can differentiate between these categories with high accuracy.

🧠 Model Architecture: I've implemented a state-of-the-art CNN architecture tailored for image classification. The network comprises multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, enabling the model to learn hierarchical features from the images.

🔧 Data Preprocessing: I've paid special attention to data preprocessing to ensure optimal model performance. This involves resizing images to a consistent dimension, normalizing pixel values, and data augmentation to enhance the model's generalization ability.

⚙️ Training and Validation: The dataset was split into training and validation sets, allowing me to train the model while monitoring its performance on unseen data. I used TensorFlow's powerful functionalities to efficiently train the network and prevent overfitting.

📊 Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This provides a comprehensive view of how well the model is performing on each class.

🚀 Results and Insights: Through meticulous experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, I've achieved impressive results on the validation set. I'll also provide insights into the model's behavior, discussing cases where it excels and areas that could be further improved.

📷 Visualization: Visualizations are vital to understanding a model's behavior. I've included visualizations of training/validation loss and accuracy curves, as well as examples of the model's correct and incorrect predictions.
